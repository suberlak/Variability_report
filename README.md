# Variability_report

A repository for a technical paper accompanying research on SDSS Summer 2013 reprocessing Stripe 82 forced photometry research in SDSS_2016_paper  repository.
We describe ways to distinguish variability from noise, ranging from time-domain (chi2, BIC, Bayesian parametrization) to frequency-domain (Lomb-Scargle periodogram).
