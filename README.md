# Variability_report

A repository for a technical paper, that together  with a [Faint Pipeline Report](https://github.com/suberlak/Faint_pipeline_report) accompany the data-driven research paper on SDSS Stripe 82 Summer 2013 reprocessing [SDSS_2016_paper](https://github.com/suberlak/SDSS_2016_paper/).
We describe ways to distinguish variability from noise, ranging from time-domain (chi2, BIC, Bayesian parametrization) to frequency-domain (Lomb-Scargle periodogram).
