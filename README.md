# Variability_report

A repository for a technical paper, along with [Faint Pipeline Report](https://github.com/suberlak/Faint_pipeline_report) accompanying research on SDSS Summer 2013 reprocessing Stripe 82 forced photometry research in [SDSS_2016_paper](https://github.com/suberlak/SDSS_2016_paper/)  repository.
We describe ways to distinguish variability from noise, ranging from time-domain (chi2, BIC, Bayesian parametrization) to frequency-domain (Lomb-Scargle periodogram).
